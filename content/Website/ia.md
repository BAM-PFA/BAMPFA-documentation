Listed below are the various content types that are used by the Drupal website.


## Basic Page

The "Basic Page" content type is for generic webpages on the site meant to convey information on a particular subject. They can be used for any purpose, but are generally not ideal for information time-sensitive information, or information that becomes irrelevant at a certain time. For instance, information about admissions policies is ideal for a basic page, whereas information about admissions pricing for a specific weekend is not ideal.

## Person

The "Person" content type is representative of an individual person or entity (corporation, institution, organization). Person records do not currently have their own display, but are frequently displayed on and referenced from other content types.

**Examples**

Hans Hofmann

Janus Films

## News

The "News" content type is for posting news to the News page. These News posts show up on the News page and as individual posts.

**Examples**

## Press Release

The "Press Release" content type is for posting Press Releases. The current standard is to include dates, a photo and a link to a PDF. These press releases show up in the Press Room and as individual posts.

## Event/Film Screening

The "Event/Film Screening" content type is for event or film screenings that show up on the calendar. They are often also included as part of a Film Series, Exhibition, or Event Series.

## Art/Film Object

The "Art/Film Object" content type is meant to represent either a specific art object or a specific film (though not necessarily a specific physical copy of a film). For films, this record often indicates a specific film in the abstract and includes immutable properties such as language, cast and crew, whether it is in color, silent, etc. If any of these change, such as a film is colorized later, it should be consider a separate film. Properties that can change from screening to screening, such as format, length (different cuts/formats have different run times), subtitles (electronic intertitles can change per screening). Art and film objects do not currently have their own display, and only show up on event/screening and exhibition/series pages.

## Exhibition/Film Series

Despite the name, this content type is meant to represent Exhibitions, Film Series, AND Event Series which are basically assorted groupings of art objects, film screenings and events. These designations determine which category of On View the program shows up in, but the visual display of all three are identical. Along with curatorial text, credit lines, partners, etc, these can all display the films, art objects, and events that are associated with the program.
