SCANNING 4" X 5” TRANSPARENCIES

**ABOUT**

4" x 5” transparencies (positive large format film shot with a "real” camera) are in many cases the only photography that exist for older BAMPFA collection works. Many of these were shot by Ben Blackwell through the early 2000s before digital cameras replaced film for art collection documentation.

**HOW TO**

Please wear a pair of white cotton gloves when handling photographs or film. Use one of the Epson 10,000XL scanners in the library or the communications office. Use a film scanning tray and open the holder so you can place the 4 x 5 into the tray with the **emulsion side facing up.** The emulsion side of film should look slightly dull or matte and you may be able to see a faint outline of the image if you look at it at an angle. The base side is entirely glossy. 

Place the tray on the scanner bed with the edge of the tray to the right of the mark that says "Film Area." Remove the cover from the film scanner surface (the white plastic thing covering the upper glass) and close the lid. 

Open the EpsonScan software and make sure that the settings are as follows: 

Professional Mode

Document type = Film (not Reflective)

16 bit grayscale/48 bit color as appropriate

4000 dpi resolution (yes 4000 dpi!)

Make a preview scan so you can see the tray on the scanner bed. Select a small area of the film in the preview window and hit the auto-focus button. It might take a second to refocus. Now select the entire 4 x 5 film you want to scan. Since the resolution is so high you will only be able to scan one transparency at a time. Don’t worry too much if the film is not square or if you scan a little extra. You will crop and straighten in Photoshop.

Hit scan and in the Save dialog box choose a filename that follows our [naming conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TgSU7RLQrvRud6O1BdwI5NbtBtP7CN5v1cPEbxSdgNs). It will take somewhere around 10 minutes to complete the scan, so go get a cup of coffee. 

That’s it! The same guidelines apply if you want to scan other film formats as well (except you can scan a whole row of 35mm film at a time rather than a single frame).
