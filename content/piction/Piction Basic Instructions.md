# General information

Piction is intended to be the primary place to store and share images internally, arcoss all of BAMPFA. We can use this system to create checklists, compile images for publications, fulfill research requests, and many other tasks. Piction is accessed via the web using the following URL:

[bampfa.org/piction](http://bampfa.org/piction)

Please bookmark this URL. Piction requires Firefox to run properly. It won’t work in Chrome. If you need help with logging in (or anything else), please email Michael.

## Organization and web interface

The Piction folder structure divides images into several distinct categories. CSpace refers to the art collection. Events includes event documentation and publicity images. Gallery Exhibitions includes install shots and images of non-collection art. Institutional is mostly facility images and logos. PFA Film Stills is primarily for film stills.

![categories](BAMPFA-documentation/images/piction/piction_categories.jpg)

Nested within each of these "categories" you may find various subfolders. When you reach a folder that does not have subfolders, there will be no “+” symbol. Simply click on the folder name and the contents will display in the main panel, while the folder name will appear at the top of the main panel. You can click on any folder name to view all its contents, including anything in any subfolders.
![folders](/images/piction/piction_subfolders.jpg)

You can adjust the size of the thumbnails displayed in the main panel by dragging the "Thumbnail slider" at the top of the screen:

![thumbnail](/BAMPFA-documentation/images/piction/piction_thumbnail-slider.jpg)

The list of assets in the main panel contains several pieces of information: 

![abc](images/piction/piction_image-info.jpg)

a. the image thumbnail

b. various options available with this image (more on these below)

c. three pieces of metadata about the image (the metadata displayed here varies by category)

At the right of the screen is the metadata panel, which displays detailed information about each image (when available). Simply click on an image to see metadata about it.

![meatadata panel](images/piction/piction_metadata.jpg)

Aside from the four BAMPFA fields at the top, the metadata fields vary by category. In this example, in addition to the 4 BAMPFA fields, we see information that comes from the art collection database under the CSPACE header. For Events, Gallery Exhibitions, Film Stills, etc. you will see a different set of fields with information specific to that kind of image. Click on each section header to expand/collapse. 

Note that the metadata about the image you selected will stay visible until you click on another image to view its metadata. 

## Basic image functions

If you just need to see a larger version of an image, you can double click on the thumbnail. The filename is displayed above it.

Looking below each image thumbnail you see a set of small icons. These allow you to you to perform various functions with an image, including downloading. 

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_individual-icons.jpg?height=200px)The "D" icon indicates that there are detail images associated with the "primary object". *This is a concept that applies only to the art collection images*. Click on the “D” to display all “non-primary” images. In short, there may be a “primary” image for a work, as well as various details, derivatives, alternative views, etc. Only the “primary” image displays on the main panel, but clicking on the “D” shows you any additional images that are associated with a work. 

Next is the download button. A dialog box will appear asking what you would like to do next. Currently, most staff have immediate access to a maximum 1200 pixel width image. You can request a full size image if needed. In this window, you can either open the 1200 pixel image in a new window or save the image to your computer.

The magnifying glass opens a viewer in which you can zoom into an image for closer inspection and view its metadata.

The shopping cart icon adds the image to your request queue, if you need access to a set of images at full resolution. 

The printer icon prepares a printer-friendly view of the image in a new window. It includes a small version of the image, as well as a set of key metadata fields.

**Detail/Primary Images**

For each of our art collection works there is  a "primary" image, and other images associated with that work are “detail” images. You can tell that detail images exist if there is a "D" icon under the image. 

Clicking on the D reveals one or more details (in this example there are 5 images total):  ![image alt text](images/piction/piction_details_view.jpg)

Notice that the image above has a yellow star under it in this view. That means that it is the primary image, while the grey stars indicate details. 

## Basic Searching

The basic keyword search box at the top of the screen is a good first step if you are looking for something in particular, for example, images under a specific accession number or title. You can also use it to find images using a keyword. This search looks across ALL of the BAM/PFA collections at once, such as Events, CSpace/Artworks, Gallery Exhibitions, PFA Film Stills, etc. 

Searching for **1974.6** gives us the result below: 

![acc result](images/piction/piction_acc-no-result.jpg)

(In order to see any details of this painting, we can click on the details icon below the thumbnail)

We could also start a search for **india**, which returns almost 1300 results. This is unwieldy.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_search-india.jpg)

By next clicking on the "Search within results" box and entering **elephant*** (add an asterisk “*”) we find all the objects with “india” and “elephant” or “elephant’s” or  “elephants” (etc.), including the painting that we were looking for.  Entering **elephant** without quote marks will find “india” and “elephant” but *not* “elephants.”

 

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_search-widlcard.jpg)

If you want to see what we have for "india" without elephants, try “india -elephant”:

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_search-minus.jpg)

Another basic search tool to use are the blue keywords you can see in some fields in the Metadata panel.

Clicking on the keywords in this example performs a search for every artwork by "Calder, Alexander," or everything of the Item Class “Sculpture.” If you want to refine these searches, you can again use the “Search within results” option, but there are other tricks you can use too.

For example, below are all the records in Piction for the Item Class "**Sculpture**:"

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_search-sculpture.jpg)

Out of 788 results, there are many "Data" records that do not have images. You can filter these results to show only images by using the “Media type filter” drop down menu at the top of the screen...

...which gives you a more useful set of 78 artworks. This filter can be used in other instances where you may want to limit your search to particular kinds of files.

## Advanced search

You can use the steps listed above in combination with the "Advanced Search" function if you need to make more complex searches. This function lets you search for keywords in specific fields. The button is next to the simple search field.

Clicking on "Advanced Search" brings up this window: 

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_search-advanced.jpg)

The "Default Collection" is the art collection for most staff, so the fields you choose from will be specific to the art collection. Simply choose another collection if you need to search for film stills, event photos, etc. *Collections cannot be combined in this search because the fields are specific to each collection.*

To start an advanced search just select a field from the dropdown menu. You can add or remove fields as needed with the green and red "+" and “-” symbols.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_search-advanced-hawk.jpg)

The above search for "**calder**" in the artist field and “**hawk**” in the title field gives us this result:  

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_search-hawk-result.jpg)

You can try out the OR and NOT options if you need to refine your search further:

If you need to repeat an advanced search frequently, you can save the search and have easy access to it from the Advanced Search screen later. Once you hit "search" the search will be saved and you will see it in your saved search list next time you open Advanced Search.

## Lightboxes

Lightboxes are a way to group images so that you can review them together, share the grouping with other staff members, download or email small copies of the images, and export the group to Excel or PowerPoint documents.

The lightbox panel is at the left of the screen. Simply click on the word "Lightbox" to expand the panel and see lightboxes that you have created or that are shared with you.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-list.jpg)

To view the contents of a lightbox in the lower panel, click on its name. In this example, there is only one image in the "Hofmann Paintings" lightbox.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-view.jpg)

To create a new lightbox, click on the folder with a green plus sign next to the word "lightbox."

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-add.jpg)



In the dialog box that opens, name your lightbox. You can also use the list of staff to choose who will see your lightbox.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-name.jpg?height=350px)

If you want to share the lightbox with more than one person, hold down the Command key when you click to select or deselect multiple users. 

Your new lightbox will appear in the list in the lefthand Lightbox panel. Click on its title so that you can drag images into it using the lower panel.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-new-view.jpg)


To start adding images to the lightbox, perform a search or open a folder of images so that you see the images you want in the main screen. Simply drag the image you want to put in your lightbox into the lower panel to add it. You can also select and drag more than one image at a time.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-add-images.jpg)

Once you have selected images you want to group, click on the small white arrow next to the lightbox name. This will reveal the lightbox contents in the main panel. 

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-view-contents.jpg)

To export the contents of your lightbox, to edit who can view the grouping, or to make other changes, click on the small wrench icon next to the lightbox name. 

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-wrench.jpg)

In the dialog that comes up, you can click on any of the tabs along the top to make any changes or perform exports that you need. If you are making changes to your sharing settings, or to the title of the lightbox, hit "Save Changes" before closing. 

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-share.jpg)

To download, go to the Download tab, and select the image dimensions you need from the "Images" dropdown. You may have one choice or several choices:

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_lightbox-download.jpg)

To email, go to the email tab and enter the information required. Your recipient will receive links to download jpg copies of your images. You can email images to anyone in the world with this feature, **so use caution when sending copyrighted images**.

The Export to PowerPoint button automatically creates a PowerPoint document that you can download, with each image in your lightbox on a slide, and any metadata on an accompanying slide. 

The Export to Excel button allows you to select the metadata fields that you would like to see along with the thumbnail that is automatically included. The fields you select will become the column headers for your spreadsheet. To select multiple fields, hold down **shift** and click to select a range, or press **command** and click to select non-contiguous options.

![image alt text](images/piction/piction_excel-export.jpg)

To remove an image from your lightbox, simply drag it to the recycling bin at the bottom right of the screen.
