*Updated 2017-03-27*

Filenaming is one of the most important things you do to a digital image after you click the shutter or press "scan." It is the first line of defense in making sure your image is not lost in the digital ether. For Art Collection images in Piction, it is absolutely critical to follow the naming conventions here. You’ll see references to metadata here, which you can learn more about [from this document](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/document/d/15ZfRbz16NZaRjWAGs6aCE2R7G_jbtgRbNe-79aBNxps/edit?usp=sharing).

*_If you have any questions or qualms about the following, please ask! If you feel that something is missing please contact Michael so we can look into an update._*

## Naming Files: General Information

<span style="font-size:150%;">Length</span>

Try to keep filenames under 64 characters, including hyphens (-), underscores (_), and file extensions (.jpg, .tif, .doc, etc.).

<span style="font-size:150%;">Special Characters</span>


<span style="font-size:200%;color:red">*THIS IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT*</span>

Do not use _*ANY*_ special characters or punctuation in a file name. It will cause havoc down the road. Examples:

<span style="color:red;">*( ) @ / &#92; : * ? " \< \> ’ ; +=¨*</span>

Only use underscores, (_), hyphens (-), and alphanumerics (a-z, 0-9). If you have a special character in a title (I ♥ Huckabees, for example), spell out the word "heart" instead of using the special character.  Omit accents from áccented wórds or nämes; ¿leave.out.all.punctuation?: unnecessary apostrophe’s, commas; colons + etc.


AVOID USING ALL CAPS.


Avoid using periods in filenames other than a single period before the file type extension (.tif, .jpg, .doc, etc.). 


Divide "areas" of the filename (e.g., artist name, title of a work) with underscores and words within an “area” with hyphens. e.g. LastName_Title-of-work. Please do not use underscores between words unless they separate conceptually distinct “areas” of the file name. 

Example: 

> Chase-Riboud_All-that-rises_001.jpg

*not*

> Chase_Riboud_All_that_rises_001.jpg

For multi-word last names, use hyphens between words.

Example: For an image of Lars von Trier’s *Breaking the Waves* → *von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_001.tif*


<span style="font-size:150%;">Initial articles</span>

Omit initial articles from a title in a filename, in all languages (the, an, a, der, los, les, etc.). Any articles later in the title itself should stay in the filename. The full title, with articles, should be entered in the *Title* field in the metadata. 

Example: For an image of Michael Powell’s film *The Red Shoes* → *Powell_Red-Shoes_001.jpg*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Metadata field *Title* should read "The Red Shoes"_

Example: For an image of David Lean’s film *The Bridge on the River Kwai *→ Lean_Bridge-on-the-River-Kwai_001.tif 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Metadata field *Title* should read "The Bridge on the River Kwai"_

Example: For Pablo Picasso’s *Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon* → Picasso_Desmoiselles-d-Avignon_001.jpg

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Metadata field *Title* should read "Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon"_

Include the full name of an artwork whenever possible. If you need to truncate because of length, do not abbreviate words; instead, use as many entire words as possible.

Example: 

For W.D. Richter’s *The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension* → Richter_Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Bonzai-Across_001.jpg 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*not* Adv-Buck-Bonz-Acr-8th-Dim *not* Buckaroo-Bonzai *not* A-B-B-A-t-8th-D)

<span style="font-size:150%;">Alternative spellings</span>

When the title of an artwork or the name of an artist has various forms or spellings, default to the form of the name/title used in the most recent BAMPFA program guide. If the name  or title has not appeared in the program guide and there is no preferred spelling/form indicated by the BAM/PFA style guide, default to the form found in the Getty Union List of Artist Names ([link](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/)), the Library of Congress Name Authority ([link](http://authorities.loc.gov/)), or another reference source: for film titles, try [Variety](http://variety.com/results/#?q=) or [Film Index International](http://search.proquest.com/fii) (contact library staff for help connecting to these). 

Examples:

For the artist 艾未未 → Ai Weiwei *not* Ài Wèi wèi

For the director 侯孝賢 → Hou Hsiao-Hsien *not* Hóu Xiàoxián

For the director Сергей Михайлович Эйзенштейн → Sergei Eisenstein *not* S. M. Ejzenstein

For the painting *La gioconda* → *Mona Lisa* *not* *La joconde*

For the film *À bout de souffle* → *Breathless* *not* *À bout de souffle*

<span style="font-size:150%;">Numbering</span>

Use  three digits to indicate the image number: e.g. _001, _002, etc. not _1, _2. Use these numbers even if we currently have only one image for a particular work--there may well be more on the way!  If we have more than one image pertaining to a particular work, number them consecutively. 

Please check that we do not already have images of the same work in Piction before labeling your image _001. If there are already images, start your numbering where they leave off. Example: if we have 001-004, you would start at 005.

Example: 

von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_001.tif

von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_002.tif

von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_003.tif

<span style="font-size:150%;">Date formatting</span>


For single dates, use the format YYYY-MM-DD 

For other date formats, such as specific months, three-month calendar periods, separate year from month or day with a hyphen and use underscores to separate other date information. For example 2011-07-08 means July 8, 2011 whereas 2011-07_08 means July–August 2011.

# Types of File Names

## Artworks NOT accessioned by BAM/PFA

**General structure:**

> ArtistLastName_Title-Of-Work_Optional-date-if-known_number.filetype

Example: 

> Baldesarri_I-Am-Making-Art_1971_001.tif

or: 

> Baldesarri_I-Am-Making-Art_001.tif


Artworks where artist is unknown:

> Unknown_Title-Of-Work_number.filetype

Example:

> Unknown_Bodhisattva-Padmapani_001.tif

(Be sure to include country of origin and/or identifying information in metadata)


Films by one director:

> DirectorLastName_Title-of-film_number.filetype

Example: 

> Wyler_Roman-Holiday_001.jpg

 

Films by more than one director

> Collaboration_Title-of-film_number.filetype

Example: 

> Collaboration_Kinshasa-Symphony_001.jpg

(Be sure to include all director names in metadata)

 

 

## Artworks in the BAMPFA permanent collection

_Note: only specific staff may upload collection images; if you find yourself with collection images, please pass them along to Michael or Tracy_

General structure:

> bampfa_accession-number_page number or view_derivative number.filetype

Example:  bampfa_1960-69-2_003_1.tif

 

For BAM collection items, replace periods in accession numbers with hyphens. 

Example: For the painting with accession number 1998.42.5 *→* bampfa_1998-42-5_001_1.tif 

 

The page number or view can be used for multiple pages of a document such as an artist book or multiple views (front, side, back, etc) of a work, or a different version of the same image (e.g. a view from a 4 x 5" slide vs. one from a digital scan would be different versions).

Use three numerals for "view" eg. 001, 002, etc.

 

Use the following derivative numbers:

_1 = master TIF with color bar

_4 = TIF without color bar (full size version that is cropped)

_5 = image of any format from a source other than the normal BAMPFA workflow, typically from a gallery, a donor, etc. Image is potentially ready for web display

_6 = reference-only snapshot, primarily by BAMPFA staff; *NOT FOR WEB DISPLAY*

We formerly used _2 and _3 to denote jpeg derivatives based on the original TIF. PLEASE DON’T USE THESE SUFFIXES.

 

## Installation images

General structure:

> Install_Exhibition-Name_YearOpened_view number.tif

Example: Install_Create_2011_002.tif

 

Use three numerals for "view" eg. 001, 002, etc.

 

For the MFA exhibits, the exhibition name is just MFA

Example:  Install_MFA_2011_001.tif

 

For MATRIX exhibits, exhibition name is just "matrix" and the MATRIX exhibition number with a hyphen.

Example: Install_matrix-239_2011_003.tif


## Press Clippings for Exhibitions

General structure:

> Press_Exhibition-Name_YearOpened_view number.tif


## Institutional Images: Events and other "museum life" images

General structure: 

> Type_Keyword_Descriptive-Name_full-date_number.filetype

If an institution supplies new or updated logos over time, record the logo year as a subfolder and note it in the metadata.
