# Metadata instructions by Piction collection

You will notice that each collection in Piction (CSpace, Events, Film Stills, etc.) has its own set of metadata fields. This guide should help you figure out what the field names mean and what kind of info to enter into each field. In many cases you won’t have definitive information for a given field. When in doubt, leave a field blank rather than guess and potentially enter incorrect information.

This guide is organized by Piction "Collection" (top-level groups) and by the the metadata tabs that you see on the right of your Piction screen. It might be helpful to open Piction and follow along. If you have any questions at all please contact Michael.

Please be aware that if you want to enter multiple values in a field, separate each entry with a semi-colon (;). For example: "Artist/Film maker: Jean-Luc Godard; Hans Hofmann"
