CINEFILES SCANNING AND UPLOADING DIRECTIONS

## Before you start scanning

Make a folder for yourself where you will save all your work for the day. Name it according to this structure:**YYMMDDyourname** Example: 150729Maya

* Put the folder into the Cinefiles folder: CINEFILES>IMAGES IN PROCESS

## Get ready to scan!

Look in the compact shelving drawer or ask Jason for documents that need to be scanned.	

* If you start to scan an entire folder of documents, be sure to keep them together, and keep scanned documents separate from unscanned ones. It helps to plan your scanning shift so that you complete a folder that you begin.

 On the back page of each document, you will find a document number and the total number of pages in the document: ex: 1p #56123; 24pp. #56124

* Take note of this number. You will use it to name your image files and to look up the corresponding document record in Collection Space.

Decide whether you will scan the document in Grayscale (black and white) or Color (color).

## Now, really get ready to scan

Turn on the scanner, then open Epson Scan. It is in the dock and looks like a little scanner.

Take a look at the settings in the window that opens.  These are important! They should look like the picture below.

* Document Type: Reflective

* Document Source: Document Table

* Auto Exposure Type: Photo/Document depending on what you are scanning (not too critical)

* Image Type: 16-bit Grayscale or 48-bit Color

* Resolution: 300dpi

* *All the Adjustment boxes should be unckecked!*

Put the first page of your document face down on the glass. Don’t smudge the nice clean glass! Put a piece of black construction paper behind your document. There are different sizes available on the table. Having a dark background prevents whatever is on the back of the document from showing up when you scan.

* If the document has more than one page, unstaple/unclip/etc. the pages. You will scan them one at a time. Don’t lose track of the order!

* If the document is larger than the scanning area, you can scan one section at a time and stitch the pieces in Photoshop. See the Special Cases section at the end of this document.

Hit the Preview button. You will see a preview of the entire scanning bed with your document hopefully included. Use the cursor to select the area that you want to scan. 

* You don’t need to line the document up precisely with the edge of the scanner, or select the document in the Preview window too precisely. You will correct crooked images and do all your cropping in Photoshop. 

Hit the Scan button. A dialog box will pop up asking you how you want to save your image and where you want it saved:

Tell Epson where you want your files to be saved. You only need to set this location at the beginning of your shift, but it is important to make sure you are not saving to the last person’s folder!

* Hit the Choose… button and navigate to the folder you created earlier. Good job.

Now you will create the file name for the image you are about to create. In the Prefix box, use the document number to make a filename like the one above using this format: **####.p#.300col(or gray).tif**

* This filename format is critical. Epson also remembers this setting, so make sure that you enter the right document and page numbers each time you scan a new document. 

* You don’t need to add .tif in the Prefix box. This is added automatically. 

* Reset the Start Number to 001 for each new document. You will delete this number later, but you can use it to keep track of images in progress.

Make sure Type is set to TIFF. You can leave all the other settings alone. 

Hit OK and the scanner will start to scan. 

Repeat for the other documents in your workflow.
