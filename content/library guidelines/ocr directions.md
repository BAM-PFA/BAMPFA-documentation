# DIRECTIONS FOR OCR SCANNING 2/11/2015

## Scanning

 

1)    Log into[ http://berkeley.box.com](http://berkeley.box.com) (use your Calnet ID) and go to the **OCR Sheets** folder. Volunteers should ask Michael, Jason, or Nancy to access Box for these steps.

2)    All the film title cabinets are labeled CAB01, CAB02, etc. and there is an Excel spreadsheet for each one. Find the spreadsheet for the cabinet that you will be working on and download it. Move the spreadsheet from the desktop to the **OCR DAILY FOLDER**. This should be the only thing in the folder. If there is anything left over from the previous shift, tell Michael or Jason so that they can make sure it can be deleted.

3)    Each (normal) filing cabinet has 5 drawers with A at the top and E at the bottom. Open the Excel spreadsheet and look for the last blue line, which will tell you which drawer is currently in progress. If you need to pull envelopes to scan, this will tell you where you can pull new folders. Example: if the last blue line says "CAB01 drawer c," go to that physical drawer to pull new folders.

4)    If you are pulling new folders, take a TO SCAN box to the cabinet and look for the "DRAWER IN PROGRESS" tape tag that will confirm that you are at the right drawer. Look in the drawer for a SCANNED TO THIS POINT placeholder that will confirm where you should start pulling. Fill your box with green hanging folders. Pull entire green folders only. Start at the top of the cabinet and the front of the drawer, working down and back. Don’t cram it too full, and don’t pull from the end of one drawer and the beginning of the next (you only want to fill a box from a single drawer).

5)    If you are starting to scan folders from a new drawer, move the DRAWER IN PROGRESS tape tag to the new drawer if it is not there already. In your spreadsheet, highlight a row in blue and enter the drawer name: CAB01 drawer A, CAB37 drawer C, etc.

6)    If you are starting a new box, make a masking tape label with the cabinet name for each of your three boxes: TO SCAN, TO PROOF, and TO FILE.  

7)    When you are ready to start scanning, pull out the first green folder from your box and check that the title on the first manila envelope comes right after the last scanned entry. Even if you are continuing on a box that you started previously, check that the first new line matches with the last line you scanned. If there is a large gap in the alphabetization you might have the wrong folder.

8)    Put a stack of envelopes to scan near the computer so that you will be able to comfortably put the top envelope on the desk, scan it, then flip it over into a "done" pile. You should find a method that is comfortable for you, but do not try to scan an envelope with anything underneath it, and make sure that the envelopes in your done pile are all facing the same direction.

9)    Start scanning! Make a quick visual check as you scan for any major errors. If the envelope has clean text and you think you can get a better scan, hit COMMAND+Z and take one more shot. Don’t try to scan more than twice. If there are 1-2 character errors, go ahead and fix them. Do not try to fix more than two characters. Just move on.

10) Keep an eye on the clock. Do not finish a shift in the middle of a green folder.

11) Save your document every 20 minutes: COMMAND+S or File>Save

12) When you have finished scanning an entire green folder, turn the stack over and start proofing, or put the folder in the TO PROOF box.

13) If you need to leave before finishing an entire TO SCAN box, place an IN PROGRESS card on top of your box. Don’t forget to follow the spreadsheet saving instructions below.

 

## Proofing & Filing

 

14) When you are ready to start proofing, look for the last line highlighted in red. This is where you or the last person stopped proofing.

15) When proofing, check that there are no typos, odd characters, etc. Keep an eye out for characters that look similar, such as 2007 à 200Z ; 2001 à 200L ; Bradley à Bradlex

16) Make a quick assessment of whether or not the envelope is "minimal" by feel. Minimal envelopes have 2 or fewer documents in them. You will get a sense of what this feels like pretty quickly, so don’t waste time opening the envelope to check. If in doubt, just assume it is minimal.

17) Don’t forget to save! Keep an eye on the time so that you don’t get stuck in the middle of a green folder!

18) If an envelope is minimal, put an "x" in the MINIMAL column. Otherwise, leave it blank.

19) If a title has a press kit included, also put an "x" in the PK column.

20) When you stop proofing, either to scan more envelopes or at the end of the day, highlight the last row you proofed in red.

21) Once you have proofed an entire green folder worth of envelopes, put the folder in your TO FILE box. Make sure you are putting the green folders back in order, from front to back. Double check that you made a tag for your TO FILE box with the cabinet number on it!

22) Once you have scanned and proofed your box, the TO FILE box should be full. Take the TO FILE box to the correct cabinet and put the green folders back.

23) Place a SCANNED TO THIS POINT marker behind the last folder you just put back, unless you reached the end of the drawer. Move the IN PROGRESS tape tag to the front of the next drawer, if necessary.

 

## Saving your document

 

24) You should be saving your Excel spreadsheet every few minutes.

25) When you are done for the day, save your document again.

26) Ask Michael, Jason, or Nancy to look over your spreadsheet and upload this new version to Box. They will then delete the version from the OCR DAILY FOLDER.
