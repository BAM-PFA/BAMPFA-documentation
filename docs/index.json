	"content": "Short login screen URL: bampfa.org/piction If you have any questions about any of this, or if you experience anything unexpected while working in Piction, ask Michael, Orlando, or Dave. Don’t suffer alone! A WORD OF WARNING: DON’T TRY THIS AT HOME (WITHOUT TRAINING) IF YOU HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED PICTION TRAINING, DO NOT TRY TO UPLOAD ANY IMAGES OR EDIT ANY METADATA. Preface: about accounts Log into the account into which you need to upload images or batch edit metadata. E.g., if you have &amp;ldquo;JaneDoe-FilmStills&amp;rdquo; and “JaneDoe-GalleryExhibitions” accounts and you need to upload film stills, log into your FilmStills account. If you just need to search or put together light boxes it doesn’t matter which account you use. Foreword: about patience Piction is a delicate flower. If it stalls, gets hung up on something, or you experience odd behavior from it, take a deep breath and reload your browser window. This will solve many problems. UPLOADING In all cases, make sure you have your files named correctly before you upload. Really, it’s important. For art collection images it’s critical&amp;ndash;only specific staff should upload art collection images. Here’s a filename guide. To upload a single image 1) Click the &amp;ldquo;Individual upload&amp;rdquo; button: 2) In the window that opens, click on &amp;ldquo;Go to add images&amp;rdquo; then in the next window click on “Choose file.” You then navigate to the file you want to upload and click “Open.” Leave all the other options as-is. 3) Click on &amp;ldquo;Load Image&amp;rdquo; and in a moment you should see your image ready to go. If it’s a large image, give it a sec to load. 4) Your image will now be in the &amp;ldquo;QA&amp;rdquo; (quality assurance) folder for the collection you’re working in. Go there to add metadata and complete your work (see below). To upload images in bulk This is a two-part process: 1) load images to the remote FTP (File Transfer Protocol) folder 2) tell Piction to look for your images in the FTP folder. 1) Get your images ready in a folder on your desktop. Just one folder, please. 2) Open Cyberduck. Click on &amp;ldquo;Open Connection.&amp;rdquo; If you have done this before you can click on history and the Piction connection should be listed. Otherwise, in the connection window that opens, type in the Server: ucb1.piction.com. The username is bampfa and if you don’t have the password already, ask Michael, Orlando, or Dave. The window should look like this: You can leave all the other settings alone. Just make sure &amp;ldquo;anonymous login&amp;rdquo; isn’t checked. 3) When Cyberduck logs into the Piction FTP folder you should see this window or something similar: For everything other than art collection images, double click into Research_Hub_Collections. Go to the folder for the appropriate collection. I strongly recommend double clicking into the folder instead of expanding them so you avoid putting images in the wrong place. 4) Once you find the right folder, drag and drop your images into it. Quit Cyberduck and go back to Piction. 5) Click on Bulk Load on the main screen. In the window that opens, click on the link for Bulk Upload[PHOTO]. Then in the next window, scroll down and click on Run Load. Ignore all the extra stuff in that window and please don’t modify anything. 6) Your images are now in the QA folder. IT’S METADATA TIME Once you have loaded images into your QA folder you need to add the appropriate metadata to your images (here’s the Piction metadata guide). Very important note about something obscure: for fields like &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; (where you enter program guide tags), “People pictured,” “Artist,” or other fields where each entry turns into a link (see image above) , separate each value with a semicolon ( “;” ) In the example below, I typed “mona lisa ; bob jones.” Edit single image metadata 1) Select the image you want to work on. 2) Click on Edit metadata. 3) In the new window that opens, enter metadata into the appropriate fields for the collection you are working on. 4) When you are done go to the bottom of the window and click Save. 5) Move your image to the folder where it will ultimately live. Edit batch metadata Often, you will have a group of images that might have unique fields like &amp;ldquo;artist,&amp;rdquo; but share common data like program guide “Tags” or maybe “Title of PFA Series.” Please note that you can ONLY bulk attach metadata for images in the same category; Film with Film, Events with Events, etc. If you try to mix and match, bad things will happen. For example if you have accounts for both Film Stills and Gallery Exhibitions you’ll need to switch accounts in order to access the right bulk metadata attach template. FYI: the program guide tag is formatted &amp;ldquo;bampfaYYYY_mm-mm(-mm)&amp;rdquo; examples: bampfa2016_05-06 ; bampfa2016_02-03-04 Try it out: 1) Gather the group of images you want to work with, either within the QA folder, or using a search, or going into a specific folder. 2) Click on Metadata Attach 3) In the new window that opens, you will be asked to enter metadata that want to apply to the group of images you have in mind. Remember that each piece of data has to apply to the entire group, not just one image. 4) Enter your data. 5) When you are done, click OK. You will be directed to go back to the main window, so do that. 6) Back in in the main window, select the images you want to apply the fresh data to. Drag them over to the box that looks like the one at the right. If these images already have some metadata you really want to check the &amp;ldquo;suffix&amp;rdquo; box (see image). Otherwise you can replace what is already there and lose valuable data. Eep! 7) Click Exit Metadata Attach and you will… exit Metadata Attach. You’re done. Creating folders and moving stuff Piction makes it easy to make folders and move images around, but please keep the following points in mind. 1) Images in QA folders are not usable by everyone until you move them to the main folder for the collection where the image belongs. 2) When you create a folder (see basic training handout for instructions) your new folder is not ordered alphabetically. It goes to the bottom of the list. For example, if you have a folder &amp;ldquo;Folders&amp;rdquo; with subfolders “A” “C” “D,” and you add subfolder “B,” the new folder won’t come second, it will be last. 3) To move items you just drag and drop. Again if you have any questions or if something isn’t working for you, please ask. "

	"content": "Updated 2017-03-27 Filenaming is one of the most important things you do to a digital image after you click the shutter or press &amp;ldquo;scan.&amp;rdquo; It is the first line of defense in making sure your image is not lost in the digital ether. For Art Collection images in Piction, it is absolutely critical to follow the naming conventions here. You’ll see references to metadata here, which you can learn more about from this document. If you have any questions or qualms about the following, please ask! If you feel that something is missing please contact Michael so we can look into an update. Naming Files: General Information Length Try to keep filenames under 64 characters, including hyphens (-), underscores (_), and file extensions (.jpg, .tif, .doc, etc.). Special Characters THIS IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT Do not use ANY special characters or punctuation in a file name. It will cause havoc down the road. Examples: *( ) @ / \ : * ? &amp;ldquo; &amp;lt; &amp;gt; ’ ; +=¨* Only use underscores, (_), hyphens (-), and alphanumerics (a-z, 0-9). If you have a special character in a title (I ♥ Huckabees, for example), spell out the word &amp;ldquo;heart&amp;rdquo; instead of using the special character. Omit accents from áccented wórds or nämes; ¿leave.out.all.punctuation?: unnecessary apostrophe’s, commas; colons + etc. AVOID USING ALL CAPS. Avoid using periods in filenames other than a single period before the file type extension (.tif, .jpg, .doc, etc.). Divide &amp;ldquo;areas&amp;rdquo; of the filename (e.g., artist name, title of a work) with underscores and words within an “area” with hyphens. e.g. LastName_Title-of-work. Please do not use underscores between words unless they separate conceptually distinct “areas” of the file name. Example: Chase-Riboud_All-that-rises_001.jpg not Chase_Riboud_All_that_rises_001.jpg For multi-word last names, use hyphens between words. Example: For an image of Lars von Trier’s Breaking the Waves → von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_001.tif Initial articles Omit initial articles from a title in a filename, in all languages (the, an, a, der, los, les, etc.). Any articles later in the title itself should stay in the filename. The full title, with articles, should be entered in the Title field in the metadata. Example: For an image of Michael Powell’s film The Red Shoes → Powell_Red-Shoes_001.jpg &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Metadata field Title should read &amp;ldquo;The Red Shoes&amp;rdquo; Example: For an image of David Lean’s film *The Bridge on the River Kwai *→ Lean_Bridge-on-the-River-Kwai_001.tif &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Metadata field Title should read &amp;ldquo;The Bridge on the River Kwai&amp;rdquo; Example: For Pablo Picasso’s Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon → Picasso_Desmoiselles-d-Avignon_001.jpg &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Metadata field Title should read &amp;ldquo;Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon&amp;rdquo; Include the full name of an artwork whenever possible. If you need to truncate because of length, do not abbreviate words; instead, use as many entire words as possible. Example: For W.D. Richter’s The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension → Richter_Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Bonzai-Across_001.jpg &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(not Adv-Buck-Bonz-Acr-8th-Dim not Buckaroo-Bonzai not A-B-B-A-t-8th-D) Alternative spellings When the title of an artwork or the name of an artist has various forms or spellings, default to the form of the name/title used in the most recent BAMPFA program guide. If the name or title has not appeared in the program guide and there is no preferred spelling/form indicated by the BAM/PFA style guide, default to the form found in the Getty Union List of Artist Names (link), the Library of Congress Name Authority (link), or another reference source: for film titles, try Variety or Film Index International (contact library staff for help connecting to these). Examples: For the artist 艾未未 → Ai Weiwei not Ài Wèi wèi For the director 侯孝賢 → Hou Hsiao-Hsien not Hóu Xiàoxián For the director Сергей Михайлович Эйзенштейн → Sergei Eisenstein not S. M. Ejzenstein For the painting La gioconda → Mona Lisa not La joconde For the film À bout de souffle → Breathless not À bout de souffle Numbering Use three digits to indicate the image number: e.g. _001, _002, etc. not _1, _2. Use these numbers even if we currently have only one image for a particular work&amp;ndash;there may well be more on the way! If we have more than one image pertaining to a particular work, number them consecutively. Please check that we do not already have images of the same work in Piction before labeling your image _001. If there are already images, start your numbering where they leave off. Example: if we have 001-004, you would start at 005. Example: von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_001.tif von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_002.tif von-Trier_Breaking-the-Waves_003.tif Date formatting For single dates, use the format YYYY-MM-DD For other date formats, such as specific months, three-month calendar periods, separate year from month or day with a hyphen and use underscores to separate other date information. For example 2011-07-08 means July 8, 2011 whereas 2011-07_08 means July–August 2011. Types of File Names Artworks NOT accessioned by BAM/PFA General structure: ArtistLastName_Title-Of-Work_Optional-date-if-known_number.filetype Example: Baldesarri_I-Am-Making-Art_1971_001.tif or: Baldesarri_I-Am-Making-Art_001.tif Artworks where artist is unknown: Unknown_Title-Of-Work_number.filetype Example: Unknown_Bodhisattva-Padmapani_001.tif (Be sure to include country of origin and/or identifying information in metadata) Films by one director: DirectorLastName_Title-of-film_number.filetype Example: Wyler_Roman-Holiday_001.jpg Films by more than one director Collaboration_Title-of-film_number.filetype Example: Collaboration_Kinshasa-Symphony_001.jpg (Be sure to include all director names in metadata) Artworks in the BAMPFA permanent collection Note: only specific staff may upload collection images; if you find yourself with collection images, please pass them along to Michael or Tracy General structure: bampfa_accession-number_page number or view_derivative number.filetype Example: bampfa_1960-69-2_003_1.tif For BAM collection items, replace periods in accession numbers with hyphens. Example: For the painting with accession number 1998.42.5 → bampfa_1998-42-5_001_1.tif The page number or view can be used for multiple pages of a document such as an artist book or multiple views (front, side, back, etc) of a work, or a different version of the same image (e.g. a view from a 4 x 5&amp;rdquo; slide vs. one from a digital scan would be different versions). Use three numerals for &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; eg. 001, 002, etc. Use the following derivative numbers: _1 = master TIF with color bar _4 = TIF without color bar (full size version that is cropped) _5 = image of any format from a source other than the normal BAMPFA workflow, typically from a gallery, a donor, etc. Image is potentially ready for web display _6 = reference-only snapshot, primarily by BAMPFA staff; NOT FOR WEB DISPLAY We formerly used _2 and _3 to denote jpeg derivatives based on the original TIF. PLEASE DON’T USE THESE SUFFIXES. Installation images General structure: Install_Exhibition-Name_YearOpened_view number.tif Example: Install_Create_2011_002.tif Use three numerals for &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo; eg. 001, 002, etc. For the MFA exhibits, the exhibition name is just MFA Example: Install_MFA_2011_001.tif For MATRIX exhibits, exhibition name is just &amp;ldquo;matrix&amp;rdquo; and the MATRIX exhibition number with a hyphen. Example: Install_matrix-239_2011_003.tif Press Clippings for Exhibitions General structure: Press_Exhibition-Name_YearOpened_view number.tif Institutional Images: Events and other &amp;ldquo;museum life&amp;rdquo; images General structure: Type_Keyword_Descriptive-Name_full-date_number.filetype Example: Event_Late_Early-the-sun-part-one_2012-02-05_001.jpg Choose an appropriate type and keyword from the lists below in addition to the name of the program, guest, or speaker.

	"content": "CINEFILES SCANNING AND UPLOADING DIRECTIONS Before you start scanning Make a folder for yourself where you will save all your work for the day. Name it according to this structure:YYMMDDyourname Example: 150729Maya Put the folder into the Cinefiles folder: CINEFILES&amp;gt;IMAGES IN PROCESS Get ready to scan! Look in the compact shelving drawer or ask Jason for documents that need to be scanned. If you start to scan an entire folder of documents, be sure to keep them together, and keep scanned documents separate from unscanned ones. It helps to plan your scanning shift so that you complete a folder that you begin. On the back page of each document, you will find a document number and the total number of pages in the document: ex: 1p #56123; 24pp. #56124 Take note of this number. You will use it to name your image files and to look up the corresponding document record in Collection Space. Decide whether you will scan the document in Grayscale (black and white) or Color (color). Now, really get ready to scan Turn on the scanner, then open Epson Scan. It is in the dock and looks like a little scanner. Take a look at the settings in the window that opens. These are important! They should look like the picture below. Document Type: Reflective Document Source: Document Table Auto Exposure Type: Photo/Document depending on what you are scanning (not too critical) Image Type: 16-bit Grayscale or 48-bit Color Resolution: 300dpi All the Adjustment boxes should be unckecked! Put the first page of your document face down on the glass. Don’t smudge the nice clean glass! Put a piece of black construction paper behind your document. There are different sizes available on the table. Having a dark background prevents whatever is on the back of the document from showing up when you scan. If the document has more than one page, unstaple/unclip/etc. the pages. You will scan them one at a time. Don’t lose track of the order! If the document is larger than the scanning area, you can scan one section at a time and stitch the pieces in Photoshop. See the Special Cases section at the end of this document. Hit the Preview button. You will see a preview of the entire scanning bed with your document hopefully included. Use the cursor to select the area that you want to scan. You don’t need to line the document up precisely with the edge of the scanner, or select the document in the Preview window too precisely. You will correct crooked images and do all your cropping in Photoshop. Hit the Scan button. A dialog box will pop up asking you how you want to save your image and where you want it saved: Tell Epson where you want your files to be saved. You only need to set this location at the beginning of your shift, but it is important to make sure you are not saving to the last person’s folder! Hit the Choose… button and navigate to the folder you created earlier. Good job. Now you will create the file name for the image you are about to create. In the Prefix box, use the document number to make a filename like the one above using this format: ####.p#.300col(or gray).tif This filename format is critical. Epson also remembers this setting, so make sure that you enter the right document and page numbers each time you scan a new document. You don’t need to add .tif in the Prefix box. This is added automatically. Reset the Start Number to 001 for each new document. You will delete this number later, but you can use it to keep track of images in progress. Make sure Type is set to TIFF. You can leave all the other settings alone. Hit OK and the scanner will start to scan. Repeat for the other documents in your workflow. "

	"content": "DIRECTIONS FOR OCR SCANNING 2/11/2015 Scanning 1) Log intohttp://berkeley.box.com (use your Calnet ID) and go to the OCR Sheets folder. Volunteers should ask Michael, Jason, or Nancy to access Box for these steps. 2) All the film title cabinets are labeled CAB01, CAB02, etc. and there is an Excel spreadsheet for each one. Find the spreadsheet for the cabinet that you will be working on and download it. Move the spreadsheet from the desktop to the OCR DAILY FOLDER. This should be the only thing in the folder. If there is anything left over from the previous shift, tell Michael or Jason so that they can make sure it can be deleted. 3) Each (normal) filing cabinet has 5 drawers with A at the top and E at the bottom. Open the Excel spreadsheet and look for the last blue line, which will tell you which drawer is currently in progress. If you need to pull envelopes to scan, this will tell you where you can pull new folders. Example: if the last blue line says &amp;ldquo;CAB01 drawer c,&amp;rdquo; go to that physical drawer to pull new folders. 4) If you are pulling new folders, take a TO SCAN box to the cabinet and look for the &amp;ldquo;DRAWER IN PROGRESS&amp;rdquo; tape tag that will confirm that you are at the right drawer. Look in the drawer for a SCANNED TO THIS POINT placeholder that will confirm where you should start pulling. Fill your box with green hanging folders. Pull entire green folders only. Start at the top of the cabinet and the front of the drawer, working down and back. Don’t cram it too full, and don’t pull from the end of one drawer and the beginning of the next (you only want to fill a box from a single drawer). 5) If you are starting to scan folders from a new drawer, move the DRAWER IN PROGRESS tape tag to the new drawer if it is not there already. In your spreadsheet, highlight a row in blue and enter the drawer name: CAB01 drawer A, CAB37 drawer C, etc. 6) If you are starting a new box, make a masking tape label with the cabinet name for each of your three boxes: TO SCAN, TO PROOF, and TO FILE. 7) When you are ready to start scanning, pull out the first green folder from your box and check that the title on the first manila envelope comes right after the last scanned entry. Even if you are continuing on a box that you started previously, check that the first new line matches with the last line you scanned. If there is a large gap in the alphabetization you might have the wrong folder. 8) Put a stack of envelopes to scan near the computer so that you will be able to comfortably put the top envelope on the desk, scan it, then flip it over into a &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; pile. You should find a method that is comfortable for you, but do not try to scan an envelope with anything underneath it, and make sure that the envelopes in your done pile are all facing the same direction. 9) Start scanning! Make a quick visual check as you scan for any major errors. If the envelope has clean text and you think you can get a better scan, hit COMMAND+Z and take one more shot. Don’t try to scan more than twice. If there are 1-2 character errors, go ahead and fix them. Do not try to fix more than two characters. Just move on. 10) Keep an eye on the clock. Do not finish a shift in the middle of a green folder. 11) Save your document every 20 minutes: COMMAND+S or File&amp;gt;Save 12) When you have finished scanning an entire green folder, turn the stack over and start proofing, or put the folder in the TO PROOF box. 13) If you need to leave before finishing an entire TO SCAN box, place an IN PROGRESS card on top of your box. Don’t forget to follow the spreadsheet saving instructions below. Proofing &amp;amp; Filing 14) When you are ready to start proofing, look for the last line highlighted in red. This is where you or the last person stopped proofing. 15) When proofing, check that there are no typos, odd characters, etc. Keep an eye out for characters that look similar, such as 2007 à 200Z ; 2001 à 200L ; Bradley à Bradlex 16) Make a quick assessment of whether or not the envelope is &amp;ldquo;minimal&amp;rdquo; by feel. Minimal envelopes have 2 or fewer documents in them. You will get a sense of what this feels like pretty quickly, so don’t waste time opening the envelope to check. If in doubt, just assume it is minimal. 17) Don’t forget to save! Keep an eye on the time so that you don’t get stuck in the middle of a green folder! 18) If an envelope is minimal, put an &amp;ldquo;x&amp;rdquo; in the MINIMAL column. Otherwise, leave it blank. 19) If a title has a press kit included, also put an &amp;ldquo;x&amp;rdquo; in the PK column. 20) When you stop proofing, either to scan more envelopes or at the end of the day, highlight the last row you proofed in red. 21) Once you have proofed an entire green folder worth of envelopes, put the folder in your TO FILE box. Make sure you are putting the green folders back in order, from front to back. Double check that you made a tag for your TO FILE box with the cabinet number on it! 22) Once you have scanned and proofed your box, the TO FILE box should be full. Take the TO FILE box to the correct cabinet and put the green folders back. 23) Place a SCANNED TO THIS POINT marker behind the last folder you just put back, unless you reached the end of the drawer. Move the IN PROGRESS tape tag to the front of the next drawer, if necessary. Saving your document 24) You should be saving your Excel spreadsheet every few minutes. 25) When you are done for the day, save your document again. 26) Ask Michael, Jason, or Nancy to look over your spreadsheet and upload this new version to Box. They will then delete the version from the OCR DAILY FOLDER. "

	"content": "Listed below are the various content types that are used by the Drupal website. test Basic Page The &amp;ldquo;Basic Page&amp;rdquo; content type is for generic webpages on the site meant to convey information on a particular subject. They can be used for any purpose, but are generally not ideal for information time-sensitive information, or information that becomes irrelevant at a certain time. For instance, information about admissions policies is ideal for a basic page, whereas information about admissions pricing for a specific weekend is not ideal. Examples http://bampfa.org/visit/hours http://bampfa.org/about/history-mission Person The &amp;ldquo;Person&amp;rdquo; content type is representative of an individual person or entity (corporation, institution, organization). Person records do not currently have their own display, but are frequently displayed on and referenced from other content types. Examples Hans Hofmann Janus Films News The &amp;ldquo;News&amp;rdquo; content type is for posting news to the News page. These News posts show up on the News page and as individual posts. Examples http://bampfa.org/news http://bampfa.org/news/film-table-dinner-and-movie-bampfa-and-babette Press Release The &amp;ldquo;Press Release&amp;rdquo; content type is for posting Press Releases. The current standard is to include dates, a photo and a link to a PDF. These press releases show up in the Press Room and as individual posts. Examples http://bampfa.org/press http://bampfa.org/press/erica-deeman-silhouettes Event/Film Screening The &amp;ldquo;Event/Film Screening&amp;rdquo; content type is for event or film screenings that show up on the calendar. They are often also included as part of a Film Series, Exhibition, or Event Series. Examples http://bampfa.org/event/ayiti-mon-amour http://bampfa.org/event/artist%E2%80%99s-talk-sam-contis Art/Film Object The &amp;ldquo;Art/Film Object&amp;rdquo; content type is meant to represent either a specific art object or a specific film (though not necessarily a specific physical copy of a film). For films, this record often indicates a specific film in the abstract and includes immutable properties such as language, cast and crew, whether it is in color, silent, etc. If any of these change, such as a film is colorized later, it should be consider a separate film. Properties that can change from screening to screening, such as format, length (different cuts/formats have different run times), subtitles (electronic intertitles can change per screening). Art and film objects do not currently have their own display, and only show up on event/screening and exhibition/series pages. Examples http://bampfa.org/event/ayiti-mon-amour http://bampfa.org/program/slow-reading-slow-seeing Exhibition/Film Series Despite the name, this content type is meant to represent Exhibitions, Film Series, AND Event Series which are basically assorted groupings of art objects, film screenings and events. These designations determine which category of On View the program shows up in, but the visual display of all three are identical. Along with curatorial text, credit lines, partners, etc, these can all display the films, art objects, and events that are associated with the program.

	"description": "",
	"content": "SCANNING 4&amp;rdquo; X 5” TRANSPARENCIES ABOUT 4&amp;rdquo; x 5” transparencies (positive large format film shot with a &amp;ldquo;real” camera) are in many cases the only photography that exist for older BAMPFA collection works. Many of these were shot by Ben Blackwell through the early 2000s before digital cameras replaced film for art collection documentation. HOW TO Please wear a pair of white cotton gloves when handling photographs or film. Use one of the Epson 10,000XL scanners in the library or the communications office. Use a film scanning tray and open the holder so you can place the 4 x 5 into the tray with the emulsion side facing up. The emulsion side of film should look slightly dull or matte and you may be able to see a faint outline of the image if you look at it at an angle. The base side is entirely glossy. Place the tray on the scanner bed with the edge of the tray to the right of the mark that says &amp;ldquo;Film Area.&amp;rdquo; Remove the cover from the film scanner surface (the white plastic thing covering the upper glass) and close the lid. Open the EpsonScan software and make sure that the settings are as follows: Professional Mode Document type = Film (not Reflective) 16 bit grayscale/48 bit color as appropriate 4000 dpi resolution (yes 4000 dpi!) Make a preview scan so you can see the tray on the scanner bed. Select a small area of the film in the preview window and hit the auto-focus button. It might take a second to refocus. Now select the entire 4 x 5 film you want to scan. Since the resolution is so high you will only be able to scan one transparency at a time. Don’t worry too much if the film is not square or if you scan a little extra. You will crop and straighten in Photoshop. Hit scan and in the Save dialog box choose a filename that follows our naming conventions. It will take somewhere around 10 minutes to complete the scan, so go get a cup of coffee. That’s it! The same guidelines apply if you want to scan other film formats as well (except you can scan a whole row of 35mm film at a time rather than a single frame). "

	"title": "How to use Adobe Bridge",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Using Adobe Bridge (to batch rename &amp;amp; edit metadata) Adobe Bridge can be used to do many complex processes in managing photos, but it is easy enough to use it for some simple, handy tasks. For our purposes at BAMPFA, Bridge is best for renaming photos (to follow our naming conventions) and for adding basic metadata to images. tl;dr here&amp;rsquo;s the video: Basic Usage Bridge is laid out similarly to the Mac OS Finder window. When you open the program, typically you start out in the last place you visited in Bridge. In this example, we are in a folder called &amp;ldquo;neil jenney 1981&amp;rdquo; and you can see the contents listed along with a thumbnail of each item. To navigate to different folders, double click on them. You can click on a single item, or a group of items, in order to see info about your selection or perform some action on it. Your selection will be highlighted by a yellow box: **TIP! ** To select a range of images, click on the first one, hold down shift, then click on the last one. To select images that are not contiguous, select one, the to select any others, hold down COMMAND (⌘) and click away. Batch Renaming Images This is probably the most useful thing Bridge can do for us. Let’s say we have 100 film stills for &amp;ldquo;Some Film&amp;rdquo; by “A. Director” and we get the images named something helpful like “1.jpg” “image34.tif” etc. Bridge makes it really simple to name them correctly: Director_Some-Film_001.jpg, and so on. First, you will make life simpler by putting all the images you want to change into one folder. Once you have them in one folder, select them all by hitting &amp;ldquo;COMMAND&amp;rdquo; plus “A” : Then from the top menu bar, select Tools &amp;gt; Batch Rename&amp;hellip; The window that opens will let us build new filenames in many exciting ways. You can add and remove steps in making filenames with the + and - buttons. In our example, select Text for the first row, then Sequence Number for the second. NOTE THE UNDERSCORES! You can the select the number of digits for your sequence number, and the number at which you want to start (it doesn’t have to be 1). The default number of digits is three, which is what we use anyway. You can also see a preview of what the filenames will look like at the bottom of the window: Hit the RENAME button and you are done! As a bonus example, let’s consider that instead of &amp;ldquo;A. Director&amp;rdquo; we learn that “Some Film” was directed by Jane Doolittle. Oops! Bridge also makes it easy to replace parts of a filename. Remove any extra steps with the minus button and in the first row, select “String substitution” instead of “Text.” In the boxes that appear you want to &amp;ldquo;Find&amp;rdquo; Director and “Replace” it with Doolittle: Voilà! Editing Metadata with Bridge You can also edit some image metadata in Bridge. Unfortunately, you can’t (yet?) use Bridge to edit the metadata that we need for Piction, but you can do things like add copyright notices, photo credits, descriptions, keywords, etc. To edit one image, just select one, and to edit multiple images, select a group/range. Note that if you select a group you will apply the metadata to ALL the images, so beware. Maybe not all the photos were shot by the same person? Use your best judgment. Metadata fields are viewed and edited in the right-hand pane: If you have selected multiple images, you will see &amp;ldquo;Multiple values&amp;rdquo; for fields where images have more than one value (like filename, file size, etc.). Also, each of the menus (collapsed at right) has a different set of fields. The IPTC ones are usually the most useful. To edit a field, click into it and enter the value you want: When you navigate away from the image(s) that you were editing you will get a pop-up asking if you want to apply the changes: You could also click on the tiny, nearly invisible check mark at the bottom right corner of the program window: That’s it. If you have questions, please ask Michael for help or more instructions! "

	"title": "Introduction to Piction",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "General information Piction is intended to be the primary place to store and share images internally, arcoss all of BAMPFA. We can use this system to create checklists, compile images for publications, fulfill research requests, and many other tasks. Piction is accessed via the web using the following URL: bampfa.org/piction Please bookmark this URL. Piction requires Firefox to run properly. It won’t work in Chrome. If you need help with logging in (or anything else), please email Michael. Organization and web interface The Piction folder structure divides images into several distinct categories. CSpace refers to the art collection. Events includes event documentation and publicity images. Gallery Exhibitions includes install shots and images of non-collection art. Institutional is mostly facility images and logos. PFA Film Stills is primarily for film stills. Nested within each of these &amp;ldquo;categories&amp;rdquo; you may find various subfolders. When you reach a folder that does not have subfolders, there will be no “+” symbol. Simply click on the folder name and the contents will display in the main panel, while the folder name will appear at the top of the main panel. You can click on any folder name to view all its contents, including anything in any subfolders. You can adjust the size of the thumbnails displayed in the main panel by dragging the &amp;ldquo;Thumbnail slider&amp;rdquo; at the top of the screen: The list of assets in the main panel contains several pieces of information: a. the image thumbnail b. various options available with this image (more on these below) c. three pieces of metadata about the image (the metadata displayed here varies by category) At the right of the screen is the metadata panel, which displays detailed information about each image (when available). Simply click on an image to see metadata about it. Aside from the four BAMPFA fields at the top, the metadata fields vary by category. In this example, in addition to the 4 BAMPFA fields, we see information that comes from the art collection database under the CSPACE header. For Events, Gallery Exhibitions, Film Stills, etc. you will see a different set of fields with information specific to that kind of image. Click on each section header to expand/collapse. Note that the metadata about the image you selected will stay visible until you click on another image to view its metadata. Basic image functions If you just need to see a larger version of an image, you can double click on the thumbnail. The filename is displayed above it. Looking below each image thumbnail you see a set of small icons. These allow you to you to perform various functions with an image, including downloading. The &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rdquo; icon indicates that there are detail images associated with the &amp;ldquo;primary object&amp;rdquo;. This is a concept that applies only to the art collection images. Click on the “D” to display all “non-primary” images. In short, there may be a “primary” image for a work, as well as various details, derivatives, alternative views, etc. Only the “primary” image displays on the main panel, but clicking on the “D” shows you any additional images that are associated with a work. Next is the download button. A dialog box will appear asking what you would like to do next. Currently, most staff have immediate access to a maximum 1200 pixel width image. You can request a full size image if needed. In this window, you can either open the 1200 pixel image in a new window or save the image to your computer. The magnifying glass opens a viewer in which you can zoom into an image for closer inspection and view its metadata. The shopping cart icon adds the image to your request queue, if you need access to a set of images at full resolution. The printer icon prepares a printer-friendly view of the image in a new window. It includes a small version of the image, as well as a set of key metadata fields. Detail/Primary Images For each of our art collection works there is a &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; image, and other images associated with that work are “detail” images. You can tell that detail images exist if there is a &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rdquo; icon under the image. Clicking on the D reveals one or more details (in this example there are 5 images total): Notice that the image above has a yellow star under it in this view. That means that it is the primary image, while the grey stars indicate details. Basic Searching The basic keyword search box at the top of the screen is a good first step if you are looking for something in particular, for example, images under a specific accession number or title. You can also use it to find images using a keyword. This search looks across ALL of the BAM/PFA collections at once, such as Events, CSpace/Artworks, Gallery Exhibitions, PFA Film Stills, etc. Searching for 1974.6 gives us the result below: (In order to see any details of this painting, we can click on the details icon below the thumbnail) We could also start a search for india, which returns almost 1300 results. This is unwieldy. By next clicking on the &amp;ldquo;Search within results&amp;rdquo; box and entering elephant* (add an asterisk “*”) we find all the objects with “india” and “elephant” or “elephant’s” or “elephants” (etc.), including the painting that we were looking for. Entering elephant without quote marks will find “india” and “elephant” but not “elephants.” If you want to see what we have for &amp;ldquo;india&amp;rdquo; without elephants, try “india -elephant”: Another basic search tool to use are the blue keywords you can see in some fields in the Metadata panel. Clicking on the keywords in this example performs a search for every artwork by &amp;ldquo;Calder, Alexander,&amp;rdquo; or everything of the Item Class “Sculpture.” If you want to refine these searches, you can again use the “Search within results” option, but there are other tricks you can use too. For example, below are all the records in Piction for the Item Class &amp;ldquo;Sculpture:&amp;rdquo; Out of 788 results, there are many &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; records that do not have images. You can filter these results to show only images by using the “Media type filter” drop down menu at the top of the screen&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;which gives you a more useful set of 78 artworks. This filter can be used in other instances where you may want to limit your search to particular kinds of files. Advanced search You can use the steps listed above in combination with the &amp;ldquo;Advanced Search&amp;rdquo; function if you need to make more complex searches. This function lets you search for keywords in specific fields. The button is next to the simple search field. Clicking on &amp;ldquo;Advanced Search&amp;rdquo; brings up this window: The &amp;ldquo;Default Collection&amp;rdquo; is the art collection for most staff, so the fields you choose from will be specific to the art collection. Simply choose another collection if you need to search for film stills, event photos, etc. Collections cannot be combined in this search because the fields are specific to each collection. To start an advanced search just select a field from the dropdown menu. You can add or remove fields as needed with the green and red &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; and “-” symbols. The above search for &amp;ldquo;calder&amp;rdquo; in the artist field and “hawk” in the title field gives us this result: You can try out the OR and NOT options if you need to refine your search further: If you need to repeat an advanced search frequently, you can save the search and have easy access to it from the Advanced Search screen later. Once you hit &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo; the search will be saved and you will see it in your saved search list next time you open Advanced Search. Lightboxes Lightboxes are a way to group images so that you can review them together, share the grouping with other staff members, download or email small copies of the images, and export the group to Excel or PowerPoint documents. The lightbox panel is at the left of the screen. Simply click on the word &amp;ldquo;Lightbox&amp;rdquo; to expand the panel and see lightboxes that you have created or that are shared with you. To view the contents of a lightbox in the lower panel, click on its name. In this example, there is only one image in the &amp;ldquo;Hofmann Paintings&amp;rdquo; lightbox. To create a new lightbox, click on the folder with a green plus sign next to the word &amp;ldquo;lightbox.&amp;rdquo; In the dialog box that opens, name your lightbox. You can also use the list of staff to choose who will see your lightbox. If you want to share the lightbox with more than one person, hold down the Command key when you click to select or deselect multiple users. Your new lightbox will appear in the list in the lefthand Lightbox panel. Click on its title so that you can drag images into it using the lower panel. To start adding images to the lightbox, perform a search or open a folder of images so that you see the images you want in the main screen. Simply drag the image you want to put in your lightbox into the lower panel to add it. You can also select and drag more than one image at a time. Once you have selected images you want to group, click on the small white arrow next to the lightbox name. This will reveal the lightbox contents in the main panel. To export the contents of your lightbox, to edit who can view the grouping, or to make other changes, click on the small wrench icon next to the lightbox name. In the dialog that comes up, you can click on any of the tabs along the top to make any changes or perform exports that you need. If you are making changes to your sharing settings, or to the title of the lightbox, hit &amp;ldquo;Save Changes&amp;rdquo; before closing. To download, go to the Download tab, and select the image dimensions you need from the &amp;ldquo;Images&amp;rdquo; dropdown. You may have one choice or several choices: To email, go to the email tab and enter the information required. Your recipient will receive links to download jpg copies of your images. You can email images to anyone in the world with this feature, so use caution when sending copyrighted images. The Export to PowerPoint button automatically creates a PowerPoint document that you can download, with each image in your lightbox on a slide, and any metadata on an accompanying slide. The Export to Excel button allows you to select the metadata fields that you would like to see along with the thumbnail that is automatically included. The fields you select will become the column headers for your spreadsheet. To select multiple fields, hold down shift and click to select a range, or press command and click to select non-contiguous options. To remove an image from your lightbox, simply drag it to the recycling bin at the bottom right of the screen. "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Editing images in Photoshop for CineFiles Note July 2017: these instructions are from 2010 and need to be updated/edited for clarity Now you should have a manageable batch of images in your IN PROGRESS folder. Somewhere between 5-10 should be good, or a booklet worth of images. It depends. Open your batch of images in PS. There are lots of ways to do this. For example, you can select all the images in Finder and drag them to the PS icon in the dock. Straighten your image using the ruler tool. You can hit the keyboard shortcut &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; or find it in the tool menu bar. It’s also helpful to zoom in during many of these editing procedures so you can see what you’re doing in greater detail. Crop your document by drawing a marquee around the portion of the image you want to preserve. You need leave only a small margin (¼&amp;rdquo;) around the perimeter of the content. If the indexer has made notations about the publication name, date and page numbers somewhere on the document, retain these notes. Go to Image &amp;gt; Crop to cut away the excess border once you’ve drawn your marquee. The selection marquee can be nudged using the keyboard arrows to make finer adjustments. If you’re keeping the document in its original form, crop tightly around the outside edge. Sometimes the text isn’t printed exactly parallel to the edge of the paper; when this is the case, it’s more important to level the text and allow the paper edges to be skewed. You’ll crop around the outermost edges of the paper, even if it’s a bit crooked. If you used a black cover paper during the scan, make sure to crop that out so you don’t have a black background behind your document. (Using the Magic Wand selection tool is an efficient way to crop out your black background, taking care that you don’t also select parts of the document you mean to keep.) Select the photograph(s) in the document and adjust them for contrast and shadow details using Levels. If there are several photos on the same page, they can usually be adjusted at the same time by selecting them all. (To add to a selection or create more than one discrete selection, press Shift while drawing your marquee. To subtract from a selection, press Option while drawing the marquee.) Go to Image &amp;gt; Adjustments &amp;gt; Levels to open the Levels dialog box. An in-depth explanation of how to use Levels follows this section. Generally, you won’t need to make any color adjustments to your image, as the scanner is part of the color management system used by Photoshop and will produce fairly accurate color as viewed on your monitor. One adjustment you might make occasionally is to the saturation, as the Epson scanner tends to bump up the saturation (intensity) of color scans a bit. Go to Image &amp;gt; Adjustments &amp;gt; Hue/Saturation and move the Saturation slider 5-20 points to the left (negative numbers), until the day-glo look is toned down a notch. Use the Gaussian Blur filter to lessen the moiré patterns you may see as a result of halftone dots used when printing photographic images. Go to Filter &amp;gt; Blur &amp;gt; Gaussian Blur and enter a number somewhere between 0.1 and 1.5. The goal is to blur the halftone dots just enough to alleviate the moiré effect without unnecessarily blurring the image. You can enter a low number to start and view the effect by selecting and deselecting the Preview box, and zooming in to see what’s happening at different viewing magnifications. Click OK when satisfied with the result. Adjust the darkness and contrast of your text with Levels. At this point you still have your photograph selected, so the easiest way to select the text is to invert your selection, which will select everything except the photograph. Go to Select &amp;gt; Inverse, open Levels and make your adjustments to optimize legibility. If you’re working with a color scan, you should desaturate the text (remove any color cast) by using Image &amp;gt; Adjustments &amp;gt; Desaturate. This also has the effect of decreasing the file size, which is especially desirable when working with large color files. Our aim in using Levels for both text and photographs is to maximize the viewing quality of the documents on the CineFiles web site; we can usually improve on the quality of a poor photocopy or faded newsprint with a Levels adjustment. These adjustments are somewhat subjective, but the rule-of-thumb goals are good contrast and legibility. Clean up the document by selecting and cutting any extraneous artifacts that interfere with legibility, e.g., shadowy background spots on a bad photocopy, newsprint bleed-through on a newspaper article, or little scraps of black lines left over from moving things around. No need to get obsessive about this, just crop anything that makes it hard to read the text. Change the modeof your document from 16-bits per channel to 8-bits per channel. Go to Image &amp;gt; Mode &amp;gt; 8 Bits/Channel. This is a very important step and easy to forget. We scan in 16-bit mode for grayscale and color (16 bits per 3 color channels = 48-bit color) in order to capture the maximum amount of information during the scan. This is desirable for editing, as you’ll maintain more of the original digital information. However, the file size is too large to manage if we leave it in 16-bit mode, so the last thing to do before saving is to convert the image to 8-bit mode. "

	"content": "Metadata instructions by Piction collection You will notice that each collection in Piction (CSpace, Events, Film Stills, etc.) has its own set of metadata fields. This guide should help you figure out what the field names mean and what kind of info to enter into each field. In many cases you won’t have definitive information for a given field. When in doubt, leave a field blank rather than guess and potentially enter incorrect information. This guide is organized by Piction &amp;ldquo;Collection&amp;rdquo; (top-level groups) and by the the metadata tabs that you see on the right of your Piction screen. It might be helpful to open Piction and follow along. If you have any questions at all please contact Michael.
